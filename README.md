# S2-Netbox

## Proof of concept for interacting with the S2 Netbox Web API

The Netbox is a physical access control and security system from LenelS2. Their Web API is XML based, but I wanted a way to easily convert the requests and responses from XML to JSON. Eventually I'd want to manage conversion back to XML to complete the circle.
